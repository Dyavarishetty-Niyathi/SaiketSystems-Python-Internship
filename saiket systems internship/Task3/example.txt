Python file handling allows you to create, read, write, and modify files directly from your programs, making it essential for tasks like data storage, logging, and configuration management. Using built-in functions such as open(), you can work with files in different modes like read ('r'), write ('w'), append ('a'), or binary ('rb', 'wb'). Python automatically handles file objects through context managers (with statement), ensuring files are properly closed even if errors occur. It supports both text and binary data, making it versatile for handling everything from plain text logs to complex serialized objects. Additionally, methods like .read(), .readline(), .readlines(), .write(), and .writelines() provide fine-grained control over file operations, while exception handling ensures robust and error-free file processing.
