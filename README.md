INTERNSHIP TASKS AS A PYTHON DEVELOPER INTERN AT SAIKET SYSTEMS

This repository contains all Python tasks completed as part of my Saiket systems internship program.Each task focuses on strengthening core Python concepts such as data structures, control flow, file handling, APIs, and real-world problem solving.

>>> Task 1: To-Do List Application
- Built a command-line to-do list using Python dictionaries
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- View all tasks with status
- Delete tasks

>>> Task 2: Number Guessing Game
- Program generates a random number
- User guesses with hints (higher/lower)
- Tracks number of attempts
- Includes replay option for better user interaction

>>> Task 3: Basic File Handling
- Reads data from a text file
- Performs find and replace operations
- Writes modified content back to the file and saves the file
- Implements error handling for missing or invalid files

>>> Task 4: Web Scraping Application
- Scrapes news headlines from a website
- Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Handles network and parsing errors
- Displays data in a clean, readable format

>>> Task 5: Currency Converter
- Converts currency using real-time exchange rates
- Uses a public API (Frankfurter API)
- Validates user input and handles network errors
- Supports multiple currencies

>>> Task 6: Word Count Tool
- Analyzes a text file
- Counts:
  - Total words
  - Total lines
  - Total characters
- Performs word frequency analysis
- Displays most common words clearly

>>> Key Learnings
- Strengthened Python fundamentals
- Hands-on experience with APIs and web scraping
- Improved error handling and program structure
- Learned to build real-world, beginner-friendly applications
>>> Acknowledgment
This project was completed as part of a Python Developer Internship, focusing on practical learning and real-world application of Python concepts.
Thank you @SaiketSystems for this opportunity.
